# hello-world
The first Github *repo* – short for *repository*  

So I'm learning all about Git and Github and Source Tree and Bit bucket.

## It's a huge growth curve
But it's way cool.

I'm going to be designer and a developer. I'm also going to get really fit.

Okay I think i'm getting it now...

### What

I've added this file called index.html – amazing!
